# skill_demonstration
The main purpose of this repository is to provide an evidence to others that I have some specific skills on coding.

* Particle in Cell method (1-D plasma simulation for demonstrating Landu damping) 

* Finite Element method (Material mechanics)

* Mesh Generator (Delauney triangle)

* Conjegate Gradient (Linear Equation Solver)

* Shallow Water Equation (1-D shallow water shock wave with finite volume method)
 - AVX, MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA
 - MPI + CUDA for multi GPU case
 - OpenMP + AVX for further speed up (thread level + instruction level parallelism)
 - OpenMP + MPI

* Euler Equation (1-D shock wave with finite volume method + AUSM scheme)
 - AVX, MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA
  
* validation platform
